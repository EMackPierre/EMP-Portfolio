###Ernst M Pierre's Portfolio website
I created this website display who I am and what I can do also to showcase my projects.

##Takeaways
My biggest takeaway was learning how to make sense of someone else's code and modify it. (I started out feeling intimidated to modify anything other than HTML, but by the end was modifying the css, color palette, and even javascript with ease.) I gained a lot of knowlege with mutiple DevTools, which was extremely helpful in locating elements, styles, and javascript that I wanted to modify.

##Languages
CSS, HTML, JavaScript, BootStrap Framework
